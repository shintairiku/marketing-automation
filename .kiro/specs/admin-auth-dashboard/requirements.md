# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an admin authentication and dashboard system for the marketing automation platform. The system will provide secure access control for administrators using Google Workspace SSO restrictions, comprehensive user and organization management capabilities, and a monitoring dashboard for system oversight.

The admin system is part of a larger administrative interface that will eventually include user management, organization management, subscription management, support ticket management, announcements, messaging, and system settings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clerk Organization-Based Admin Authentication

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to authenticate using Clerk organization membership with verified domain restrictions, so that access is restricted to authorized personnel from our Google Workspace domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator attempts to sign in THEN the system SHALL verify they are a member of the designated Clerk organization (org_31qpu3arGjKdiatiavEP9E7H3LV)
2. WHEN a user tries to authenticate without organization membership THEN Clerk SHALL automatically reject the authentication attempt
3. WHEN a user authenticates with a verified domain account THEN Clerk SHALL handle domain verification automatically using the verified "shintairiku.jp" domain
4. WHEN JWT token verification is enabled THEN the system SHALL validate token signatures and organization membership claims
5. WHEN an unauthorized user attempts access THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response with appropriate error message
6. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL set admin privilege flags and create an audit log entry

### Requirement 2: Admin Authorization Middleware

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a centralized authorization system for admin endpoints, so that all admin operations are properly secured and audited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL verify Clerk organization membership using the @require_admin decorator
2. WHEN organization membership verification fails THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response
3. WHEN admin operations are performed THEN the system SHALL automatically log all actions to the audit system
4. WHEN JWT tokens are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error codes
5. WHEN admin middleware is applied THEN the system SHALL extract user context and organization membership and make it available to the endpoint

### Requirement 3: Admin Dashboard Overview

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to view key system metrics and status information on a dashboard, so that I can monitor platform health and user activity at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current active user count
2. WHEN viewing dashboard metrics THEN the system SHALL show new user registrations (daily, weekly, monthly)
3. WHEN monitoring subscriptions THEN the system SHALL display subscription status distribution and revenue metrics
4. WHEN checking system health THEN the system SHALL show API usage statistics and error rates
5. WHEN viewing organization metrics THEN the system SHALL display organization creation and membership trends
6. WHEN accessing dashboard data THEN the system SHALL refresh metrics automatically every 5 minutes
7. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display data within 2 seconds for optimal user experience

### Requirement 4: Admin User Management Interface

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage user accounts through a comprehensive interface, so that I can handle customer support requests and account issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the user management page THEN the system SHALL display a searchable list of all users
2. WHEN searching users THEN the system SHALL support filtering by email, status, plan, and registration date
3. WHEN viewing user details THEN the system SHALL show profile information, subscription status, and organization memberships
4. WHEN suspending a user account THEN the system SHALL disable access and sync with Clerk authentication
5. WHEN reactivating a user account THEN the system SHALL restore access and update all related systems
6. WHEN exporting user data THEN the system SHALL generate CSV files with selected user information
7. WHEN performing user operations THEN the system SHALL log all changes to the audit system

### Requirement 5: Admin Organization Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage organizations and their memberships, so that I can handle enterprise customer needs and resolve organizational issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing organizations THEN the system SHALL display a list with member counts and subscription status
2. WHEN managing organization members THEN the system SHALL allow adding, removing, and changing member roles
3. WHEN viewing organization details THEN the system SHALL show subscription information, member list, and usage statistics
4. WHEN transferring organization ownership THEN the system SHALL update ownership and maintain data integrity
5. WHEN deleting organizations THEN the system SHALL handle member reassignment and data cleanup
6. WHEN syncing with Clerk THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between Clerk organizations and database records

### Requirement 6: Audit Logging System

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all administrative actions to be logged with detailed information, so that we can maintain security audit trails and investigate issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any admin operation is performed THEN the system SHALL create a detailed audit log entry
2. WHEN logging admin actions THEN the system SHALL record timestamp, admin user ID, action type, target resource, and changes made
3. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL include IP address, user agent, and session information
4. WHEN viewing audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities
5. WHEN audit data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure tamper-proof logging with appropriate retention policies
6. WHEN critical operations occur THEN the system SHALL generate real-time alerts for security monitoring

### Requirement 7: Admin API Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent and well-documented admin APIs, so that I can build reliable administrative interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin APIs are called THEN the system SHALL return consistent response formats with proper HTTP status codes
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages without exposing sensitive information
3. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically create OpenAPI specifications
4. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN the system SHALL protect admin endpoints from abuse while allowing normal operations
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include appropriate CORS headers for admin frontend access

### Requirement 8: System Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to manage system-wide settings through the admin interface, so that I can configure the platform without requiring code deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing system settings THEN the system SHALL display configurable parameters organized by category
2. WHEN updating settings THEN the system SHALL validate input values and provide immediate feedback
3. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring system restart where possible
4. WHEN configuration is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and allow rollback capabilities
5. WHEN settings affect user experience THEN the system SHALL provide preview functionality before applying changes

### Requirement 9: Security and Performance

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the admin system to meet enterprise security standards, so that sensitive administrative operations are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin sessions are created THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate session timeout and renewal
