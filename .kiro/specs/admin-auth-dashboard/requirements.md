# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a master admin authentication and internal operations dashboard for the marketing-automation platform. The system provides secure access control for service provider administrators to manage internal platform operations, system monitoring, infrastructure management, and service provider business operations.

The master admin system focuses on internal service provider operations rather than customer management, including system health monitoring, infrastructure management, internal configuration, service deployment management, and business intelligence for service provider decision-making.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clerk Organization-Based Admin Authentication

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to authenticate using Clerk organization membership with verified domain restrictions, so that access is restricted to authorized personnel from our Google Workspace domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator attempts to sign in THEN the system SHALL verify they are a member of the designated Clerk organization (org_31qpu3arGjKdiatiavEP9E7H3LV)
2. WHEN a user tries to authenticate without organization membership THEN Clerk SHALL automatically reject the authentication attempt
3. WHEN a user authenticates with a verified domain account THEN Clerk SHALL handle domain verification automatically using the verified "shintairiku.jp" domain
4. WHEN JWT token verification is enabled THEN the system SHALL validate token signatures and organization membership claims
5. WHEN an unauthorized user attempts access THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response with appropriate error message
6. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL set admin privilege flags and create an audit log entry

### Requirement 2: Admin Authorization Middleware

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a centralized authorization system for admin endpoints, so that all admin operations are properly secured and audited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin endpoint is accessed THEN the system SHALL verify Clerk organization membership using the @require_admin decorator
2. WHEN organization membership verification fails THEN the system SHALL return a 403 Forbidden response
3. WHEN admin operations are performed THEN the system SHALL automatically log all actions to the audit system
4. WHEN JWT tokens are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error codes
5. WHEN admin middleware is applied THEN the system SHALL extract user context and organization membership and make it available to the endpoint

### Requirement 3: Master Admin Internal Operations Dashboard

**User Story:** As a service provider administrator, I want to view internal system operations and infrastructure metrics on a dashboard, so that I can monitor platform health, deployment status, and business operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the master admin dashboard THEN the system SHALL display infrastructure health metrics (CPU, memory, database performance)
2. WHEN viewing system metrics THEN the system SHALL show API response times, error rates, and service availability
3. ~~WHEN monitoring deployments THEN the system SHALL display deployment status, version information, and rollback capabilities~~
4. WHEN checking business metrics THEN the system SHALL show revenue trends, cost analysis, and profitability metrics
5. WHEN viewing service health THEN the system SHALL display external service status (Clerk, Stripe, GCP, Supabase)
6. WHEN accessing dashboard data THEN the system SHALL refresh metrics automatically every 2 minutes for real-time monitoring
7. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display critical alerts and system status within 1 second

### Requirement 4: System Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a service provider administrator, I want to manage internal system configurations and feature flags, so that I can control platform behavior and deploy changes safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing system configuration THEN the system SHALL display environment variables, feature flags, and service settings
2. ~~WHEN updating configurations THEN the system SHALL support real-time updates without service restart where possible~~
3. ~~WHEN managing feature flags THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling features with percentage rollouts~~
4. ~~WHEN configuring services THEN the system SHALL validate configuration changes before applying~~
5. ~~WHEN deploying configuration changes THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities for failed changes~~
6. ~~WHEN exporting configurations THEN the system SHALL generate backup files for disaster recovery~~
7. ~~WHEN performing configuration operations THEN the system SHALL log all changes to the audit system~~

### Requirement 5: Infrastructure and Service Management

**User Story:** As a service provider administrator, I want to manage infrastructure services and deployments, so that I can ensure platform reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing infrastructure status THEN the system SHALL display service health for all critical components
2. ~~WHEN managing deployments THEN the system SHALL allow triggering deployments, rollbacks, and health checks~~
3. WHEN monitoring services THEN the system SHALL show real-time metrics for databases, APIs, and external integrations
4. ~~WHEN scaling infrastructure THEN the system SHALL provide controls for auto-scaling and resource allocation~~
5. ~~WHEN handling incidents THEN the system SHALL provide incident management tools and communication channels~~
6. ~~WHEN maintaining services THEN the system SHALL schedule and track maintenance windows with user notifications~~

### Requirement 6: Audit Logging System

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want all administrative actions to be logged with detailed information, so that we can maintain security audit trails and investigate issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any admin operation is performed THEN the system SHALL create a detailed audit log entry
2. WHEN logging admin actions THEN the system SHALL record timestamp, admin user ID, action type, target resource, and changes made
3. WHEN audit logs are created THEN the system SHALL include IP address, user agent, and session information
4. ~~WHEN viewing audit logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities~~
5. WHEN audit data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure tamper-proof logging with appropriate retention policies
6. ~~WHEN critical operations occur THEN the system SHALL generate real-time alerts for security monitoring~~

### Requirement 7: Admin API Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent and well-documented admin APIs, so that I can build reliable administrative interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin APIs are called THEN the system SHALL return consistent response formats with proper HTTP status codes
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages without exposing sensitive information
3. ~~WHEN API documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically create OpenAPI specifications~~
4. ~~WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN the system SHALL protect admin endpoints from abuse while allowing normal operations~~
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL include appropriate CORS headers for admin frontend access

### Requirement 8: Business Intelligence and Analytics

**User Story:** As a service provider administrator, I want to access business intelligence and analytics data, so that I can make informed decisions about platform growth and optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing business analytics THEN the system SHALL display revenue trends, cost analysis, and profit margins
2. WHEN viewing usage analytics THEN the system SHALL show API usage patterns, feature adoption, and performance metrics
3. WHEN analyzing costs THEN the system SHALL break down infrastructure costs by service and usage patterns
4. ~~WHEN forecasting growth THEN the system SHALL provide predictive analytics for capacity planning~~
5. ~~WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create exportable reports for stakeholder communication~~

### Requirement 9: Security and Performance
