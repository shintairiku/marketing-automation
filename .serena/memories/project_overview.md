Shintairiku Marketing-Automation is a monorepo for a FastAPI backend and Next.js 15 frontend that automate marketing content workflows while integrating Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS). The backend lives in backend/ (FastAPI, Uvicorn, uv, Python 3.12) and exposes routers for articles, organizations, companies, style templates, and image generation. The frontend lives in frontend/ (Next.js 15, React 19, Bun, Tailwind, Clerk, Stripe) and talks to the backend through /api/proxy rewrites. Supabase migrations and configuration sit in shared/supabase/, while Dockerfiles + docker-compose provide dev containers for frontend, backend, and optional Stripe CLI.
