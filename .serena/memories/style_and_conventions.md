Backend code is modern FastAPI with Pydantic models, type hints, and uv-managed dependencies; Ruff is listed for linting/formatting, so stick to Ruff/PEP8 expectations. Frontend uses Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Tailwind, and ESLint + Prettier (see frontend/package.json). Prefer Bun scripts (bun run dev/build) and keep Tailwind utility styling consistent. Supabase types are regenerated into frontend/src/libs/supabase/types.ts via bun run generate-types after DB migrations; be mindful of keeping schema/type changes in sync.
